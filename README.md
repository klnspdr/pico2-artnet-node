## Upload to JLCPCB
To generate files for uploading to JLCPCB, the plugin ["Fabrication Toolkit"](https://github.com/bennymeg/Fabrication-Toolkit) is used. It generates Gerber and BOM/Pick'n'Places files. Upload the `.zip` in `production/` as the Gerber file and in PCBA upload `bom.csv`  and `positions.csv`
